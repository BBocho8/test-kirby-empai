Introduction:

An important component of empAI is an innovative, specially developed artificial intelligence for the precise prediction of energy consumption and production. 

The combination of AI with other data sources such as production plans and environmental data (e.g. weather and energy prices) enables companies to better understand the factors influencing energy costs and external trends. 

With a model accuracy of over 85%, AI reliably predicts energy consumption for tomorrow, next week or even the coming year.

  subtitle: Energy profiles
  description: 'Use the integrated AI to create different profiles to analyze your energy consumption and production. From daily and weekly to monthly and location-based energy profiles - everything can be modeled according to individual preferences. This allows you to find out when you consume the most electricity and at what times costs are highest. Based on these valuable insights, you can adapt your processes to achieve maximum energy efficiency.'

  subtitle: Influence of renewable energies
  description: >
    empAI gives you exclusive insights into
    the impact of self-produced renewable
    energy on your own business. The AI
    precisely analyzes how the production
    and use of wind, solar or other
    renewable energy affects your energy mix
    and production costs. By combining
    environmental data and energy profiles,
    you can find out when it makes the most
    sense to use these energies and how to
    change your processes accordingly to
    achieve more and pay less.

  subtitle: Process optimization
  description: 'With empAI, you can optimize your operating processes by linking production data and energy profiles. This is achieved by comparing production and process data, such as shift schedules and IoT machine data.  This gives you insights into when production can be carried out in the most energy-efficient way and how much energy is used in each product. This enables you to organize your processes more efficiently and make your production more cost-effective and resource-efficient.'
